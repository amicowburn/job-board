/**
 * Types for, and a typed accessor over, the audit snapshot written by
 * scripts/audit-style-usage.mjs to style-audit.generated.json.
 *
 * This file used to walk app/, components/, and lib/ itself on every
 * request (the page carried `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` so it
 * would never serve a stale snapshot). That meant a full fs walk on every
 * hit of an admin-only reference page. The walk now happens once, in the
 * script — this just imports its committed output and types it. Run
 * `npm run audit:style` to refresh the numbers; see the script for the scan
 * logic itself.
